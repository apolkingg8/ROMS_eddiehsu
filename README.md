## Feature
* Search
* Sort
* Paging

## Tech pick
* Frontend
  * [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - There is no reason to use javascript or coffeescript in this project. TypeScript provides a more robust architecture for projects, finds bugs early, and is easy to refactor.
  * [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - One of the most popular front-end frameworks, and TypeScript works well together.
  * [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - I prefer MobX to Redux. It is simple, flexible, and can build beautiful and not redundant code.
  * [TypedStyle](https://github.com/typestyle/typestyle) - A small CSS-IN-JS library. I like it, because it's very simple and intuitive.
  * [MaterialUI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) - One of the most well-known front-end UI libraries. In this project, Ant-design is also a good fit, but I prefer the Material-UI design style.
* Backend
  * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Using the same language for both the back-end and front-end is helpful in many ways, especially in situations where performance is not specifically required.
  * [TypeGraphQL](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql) - A GraphQL library that I really like. It combines well with TypeScript and ORM, making the code type-safe and more readable.
  * [GraphQL-Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga) - A simple, convenient GraphQL host. I prefer to use it, because Apollo has too many features I don't need.
  * [MikroORM](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm) - The best NodeJS ORM I know so far. Very high quality, almost bug-free (compared to TypeORM), and a query builder to use when performance is needed.
